# Copilot Knowledge Base (WIP)

This repository is a **work-in-progress knowledge base** used to support the development and testing of a Microsoft Copilot agent for higher-education course and assessment design.

It functions as a **read-only content source** for structured documents, cases, templates, and reference materials that the Copilot agent may retrieve, summarise, or ground responses against.

---

## Status

**Work in Progress**

- Content structure is evolving
- Documents may be incomplete, provisional, or superseded
- File names, folders, and conventions may change without notice
- Materials are not final, validated, or approved for reuse

Do not rely on this repository as a stable or authoritative source.

---

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Host documents and reference materials in a stable, URL-addressable form
- Support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and grounding for a Copilot agent
- Experiment with content structure, chunking, and discoverability
- Test how different document formats perform when used as AI knowledge sources

This repository is **not** intended to function as:
- An open educational resource
- A reusable template library
- A public documentation site for external users

---

## Intended Use

The materials in this repository are intended for:

- Internal experimentation and evaluation
- Copilot agent development and testing
- Demonstration and proof-of-concept work
- Review by invited collaborators or assessors

Use is governed by the licence included in this repository.

## Repository Structure (Indicative)

The structure below reflects current intent and may change:
/docs
/files – PDFs and source documents
/cases – Case studies and scenarios
/policies – Policy excerpts and guidance
/templates – Draft templates and exemplars
index.md – Top-level index for GitHub Pages
All public content is served via GitHub Pages from the `/docs` directory.

---

## GitHub Pages

This repository uses GitHub Pages to expose content at stable URLs for retrieval by the Copilot agent.

Pages output is generated directly from the `/docs` directory and is intentionally minimal.

---

## Licensing and Use Restrictions

All content in this repository is subject to the terms set out in `LICENSE.md`.

In short:
- The materials are **not open source**
- Reuse, redistribution, or derivative use is not permitted without permission
- Access is provided for viewing and internal reference only

---

## Contributions

This repository is **not open for public contribution**.

If you have been invited to provide feedback or materials:
- Do not submit pull requests without prior agreement
- Do not reuse or redistribute repository contents
- Contact the repository owner directly for guidance

## Notes

This README reflects the current state of the project and will be revised as the scope, structure, and governance of the repository mature.
